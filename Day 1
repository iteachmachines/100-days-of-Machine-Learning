So today i'll be starting with simple linear regression.

The simple linear regression model is represented like this: Ε(y) = (β0 +β1 x).

The simple linear regression equation is graphed as a straight line.

(β0 is the y intercept of the regression line.

β1 is the slope.

Ε(y) is the mean or expected value of y for a given value of x.

(x is independent variable and y is a dependent variable ,beta is ).

For theory you can find it anywhere on the internet but i'll point to some few important points to remember:


#1 Linear regression models are used to show or predict the relationship between two variables or factors.

#2 When there is one independent variable,we call it simple linear regression model but when there are more then one independent variables
we call it multiple linear regression.

#3 Regression is generally used in continous values rather than discrete values.

#4 It is a supervised machine learning algorithm.

That's all for today. Tommorow i will be implementing linear regression with both Scikit learn(popular Machine learning library) and from
scratch in python.(I don't know R lol).
