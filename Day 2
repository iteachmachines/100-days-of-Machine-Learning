#Implementing a linear regression algorithm from scratch && Scikit learn.

I have used these two sources to revise the concepts(as i have little experience with ML)

Implementing it in Scikit learn- https://stackabuse.com/linear-regression-in-python-with-scikit-learn/

Implementing it from Scratch- https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-from-scratch-cd0dee067f72

Two excellent sources to get a clear understanding about working of linear regression.
